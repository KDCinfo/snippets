# Educational Advancement 2018

## [Course Listing (SPA)](https://kdcinfo.com/app/training/) (WIP)

`Educational Advancement` is a listing of courses I've been engaged with since May 2018.

I'm in the process of creating this '[Training SPA](https://kdcinfo.com/app/training/)' as a JavaScript-based PWA (as a part of my PWA learning).

As a part of creating this SPA, I also [created a CodePen](https://codepen.io/KeithDC/pen/XYMgQj) where I was able to successfully smooth out CSS's Flexbox wrapping using CSS transitions.

Previous educational advancements can be found in the [educational section of my resume](https://kdcinfo.com/resume.php?education).
