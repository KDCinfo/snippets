# Coding Snippets

Includes random bits of detailed code with some detailed history that I've worked on at various periods.

My latest project [2020] is KD-reCall: a suite of mobile apps devoted to simple productive reminders. [free and ad-free]

Prior to that was my custom Training SPA and PWA ~2018, with some Vue and Laravel from even earlier circa 2017.

Some of my other projects are open source on GitHub as well.
